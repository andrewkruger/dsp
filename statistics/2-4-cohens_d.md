[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> The Cohen's *d* for the total weight in lbs is 0.089.  This is 3.1x greater than the Cohen's *d* for the pregnancy length, which was 0.029.  While this is an increase in effect size, there's still not a significant difference between first born and non-first born babies as this is still a small value.  Visual inspection of the histograms indicates this is a reasonable value as there is no obvious difference between the two data sets.
